# RockPaperScissors1
This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players (a user-controlled and computer-controlled)

If the player and the computer choose the same “character”, it’s a tie and the game repeats until there is a winner
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper
